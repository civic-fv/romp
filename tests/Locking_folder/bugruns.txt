This is a murphi model checker generated from the romp random walker tool.
   generated from: fixedlocking.m


CLI USAGE:    <> - required  {} - optional  * - can have 0 or more
   ./<this-file> {options}*


NOTE:
  Option flags and arguments are NOT POSIX compliant!
  Please separate all options and their arguments with spaces,
   and do not join multiple short option flags into one.
    (i.e. `-s <str/int>` and `-y` must be input as
          ``-y -s 5`` and NOT ``-ys 5``, ``-ys5``, 
            ``-ys=5``, ``-y -s=5``, or ``-y --seed=5``)

GENERAL OPTIONS:
   -h | --help      Display help information (this page).
   -y | -l          Launch without prompting (skip launch prompt).
   --list-starts    Output a list of all the ruleset expanded
     | -ls            startstates & their id's
                     (see --start-id/-sid for more info)

RANDOM WALKER OPTIONS:
  --depth <int>     Maximum number of rules to apply in a walk 
    | -d <int>        before termination.
                      default: 1024
  --threads <int>   Specifies the number of threads to use.
    | -ptn <int>      default: 14 (machine specific)
  --walks <int>     Specifies the number of random  walks to do.
     | -w <int>       default: 16 * #-of-threads
  --single-walk     Perform a single random walker on a single thread.
     | -sw            note: overrides -ptn/--threads 
                              & -w/--walks/--walk-count
  --seed <str/int>  Random seed for generating the random walks
    | -s <str/int>    default: current system time
  --even-start      Determine startstate for even distribution
    | -es             rather than random choice (default behavior).
  --start-id <id>   Set a single startstate to use (For all walks).
    | -sid <id>       <id> is an int determined by a startstate's
                      position in the file after ruleset expansion.
                      Valid <id> values are integers between:
                         0 to 15 inclusive
                      Use -ls/--list-starts to see mappings of id's
                        to the ruleset expanded startstates of
                        of your model.
                      NOTE: overrides --even-start/-es

INITIAL BFS CONFIGURATION:
You can start your romp with a limited Breadth first search by using the
 following command.  This can allow you to increase the likely converge of the
 statespace covered by each romp, but does prevent you from using the normal
 strategy of using a mass romp then repeating walks of interest in a 
 single walk with traces enabled.  This is because the pseudo random nature of
 the romp process is not preserved through the BFS process.  We recommend
 instead just rerunning the same config with traces enabled if you need more
 detailed information, it may be slower but it will work.
  --bfs {single|multi} {int}  Enables an initial Breadth First Search of the
    | -bfs {s|m} {int}          statespace, that is either single threaded or
                                multithreaded (defaults to single).
                                The BFS will terminate and a swarm of random
                                walkers will start when there are enough
                                unique states in the BFS queue to have the
                                number of walkers specified with the `-w` flag
                                where each unique state gets {int} random walks
                                to increase the total coverage
                                ({int} defaults to 16).
  --bfs-limit <int>           Sets a limit on how long the initial BFS can go
    | -bfsl <int>               on for.  This is measured in number of rules
                                applied. (<int> defaults to 32767)

PROPERTY CONFIGURATIONS:
  --no-deadlock           Disable Deadlock detection.
    | -nd                   (overrides all property options below)
  --attempt-guard {int}   Stop a random walk if no randomly 
    | -ag {int}             selected rule can be applied to a State
                            after {int} many rules in a row.
                            {int} - an optional arg (see above).
                              (default: 2x #-of-rules in the model)
  --loop-limit {int}      Same thing as --attempt-guard/-ag. 
    | -ll {int}             {int} - an optional arg (see above).
                              (default: 2x #-of-rules in the model)

Trace Options	
  --trace {dir-path}    Enable detailed traces to be made for every
    | -t {dir-path}       random walk performed. Outputs as a 
                          separate ``compressed json'' file for 
                          each random walk performed.
                          NOTE: slows down the process noticeably!
                          {dir-path} - (optional) the directory you
                            want to have the trace files output to.
                            default: "./traces/"

RESULT OUTPUT OPTIONS:
  --report-error        Provide detailed report for each walk that
    | -re                 ends in an ``error''.
    | -e                  (aka: violates a property or reaches a 
                            murphi error statement)
                          (NOTE: --single-walk/-sw only outputs 
                            this and not the summery data)  --report-all          Report on all walks not just those with 
    | --all              ``errors''. Including those stopped by 
    | -a                  the --attempt-guard/-ag/--loop-limit/-ll
                          option, or max --depth/-d being reached.
  --r-omit-state        Don't output the values in the model state
    | -ros                in the results
  --r-show-type         Output variable type next to name when
    | -rst                reporting the value of the model state
  --r-tab-size <int>    Set the indentation size for the result 
    | -rts <int>          output (NOTE: not used for trace output)
                          (default: 2)
  --r-use-tab           Indent using tab chars instead of spaces.
    | -rut                (NOTE: not used in json trace output)
                          (NOTE: overrides --r-tab-size/-rts)

RUMUR(1)                              General Commands Manual                             RUMUR(1)

NAME
       rumur - Yet another explicit state model checker

SYNOPSIS
       rumur options --output FILE [FILE]

 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 2 (press h for help or q to quit) 
DESCRIPTION
       Rumur  is  a  reimplementation of the model checker CMurphi with improved performance and a
       slightly different feature set.

OPTIONS
       --bound STEPS
              Set a limit for state space exploration. The verifier will stop checking beyond this
              depth.  A  bound  of  0, the default, indicates unlimited exploration.  That is, the
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 10 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              verifier will not stop checking until it has expanded all seen states.

       --colour [auto | off | on]
              Enable or disable the use of ANSI colour codes in the verifier's output. The default
              is auto, to auto-detect based on whether the verifier's stdout is a TTY.

       --counterexample-trace [diff | full | off]
              Set  how  counterexample  traces are printed when an error is found during checking.
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 18 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              diff, the default, prints each state showing only the differences from the  previous
              state.  full  shows  the  entire contents of each state. off disables counterexample
              trace printing altogether.

       --deadlock-detection [off | stuck | stuttering]
              Enable or disable deadlock detection. Rumur has the ability to generate  a  verifier
              that  notices when there is no valid transition out of a state and raise an error in
              this scenario. The possible modes for this check are:
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 26 (press h for help or q to quit) 

                     • off No deadlock checks are performed.

                     • stuck A deadlock is reached when arriving at a state from which  there  are
                       no enabled transitions, and an error is signaled in this case.

                     • stuttering A deadlock is reached in the same circumstances as for the stuck
                       option or additionally if there are enabled transitions but these  all  re‐
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 34 (press h for help or q to quit) 
                       sult  in  an  identical state. For CMurphi users, this is the scenario that
                       CMurphi considers to be a deadlock.

              This defaults to stuttering. However, whether such a deadlock actually represents  a
              problem  depends  on  the properties of the system you are modelling.  Hence you may
              want to change deadlock detection.

       --debug or -d
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 42 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              Enable debugging options in the generated verifier. This includes  enabling  runtime
              assertions. This will also output debugging messages while generating the verifier.

       --help
              Display this information.

       --max-errors COUNT
              Number  of  errors  the verifier should report before considering them fatal. By de‐
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 50 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              fault this is 1, that is exit as soon as an error is encountered.  However, you  may
              wish to set a higher value to get multiple error traces from a single run.

       --monopolise
              Assume  that  the machine the generated verifier will run on is the current host and
              that it will be the only process running. This flag causes the verifier  to  upfront
              allocate  a  seen  set that will eventually occupy all of memory. That is, it is the
              same as passing --set-expand-threshold 100 and --set-capacity with the total  amount
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 58 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              of physical memory available on the current machine.

       --output FILE or -o FILE
              Set path to write the generated C verifier's code to.

       --output-format [machine-readable | human-readable]
              Change the format in which the verifier displays its output. By default, it uses hu‐
              man-readable which results in progress output and then a final summary  of  the  re‐
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 66 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              sult. Using machine-readable generates output in an XML format suitable for consump‐
              tion by a following tool in an I/O pipeline.

       --pack-state [on | off]
              Set whether auxiliary state data is compressed in the generated verifier.   Compres‐
              sion  (on,  the default) saves memory at the expense of runtime. That is, by default
              the verifier will try to minimise memory usage. If your model  is  small  enough  to
              comfortably  fit  in available memory, you may want to set this to off to accelerate
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 74 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              the checking process.

       --pointer-bits [auto | BITS]
              Number of relevant (non-zero) bits in a pointer on the target platform on which  the
              verifier  will  be  compiled.  This  option can be used to tune pointer compression,
              which can save memory when checking larger models. With the default,  auto,  5-level
              paging  is  assumed  for x86-64, meaning pointers can be compressed and stored in 56
              bits. Other platforms currently have no auto-detection, and will store pointers  un‐
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 82 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              compressed  at their full width. If you know a certain number of high bits of point‐
              ers on your target platform are always zero, you can teach  Rumur  this  information
              with  this  option. For example, if you are compiling on an x86-64 platform that you
              know is using 4-level paging you can pass --pointer-bits 48 to tell Rumur  that  the
              upper 16 bits of a pointer will always be zero.

       --quiet or -q
              Don't output any messages while generating the verifier.
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 90 (press h for help or q to quit) 

       --reorder-fields [on | off]
              Control whether access to state variables and record fields is optimised by reorder‐
              ing them. By default this is on, causing the order of a model's state variables  and
              fields  within  record  types  to  be  optimised  to more likely result in naturally
              aligned memory accesses, which are assumed to be faster. You should  never  normally
              have  cause  to  turn this off, but this feature was buggy when first implemented so
              this option is provided for debugging purposes.
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 98 (press h for help or q to quit) 

       --sandbox [on | off]
              Control whether the generated verifier uses your operating system's  sandboxing  fa‐
              cilities  to  limit  its own operations. The verifier does not intentionally perform
              any malicious or dangerous operations, but at the end of the day it is  a  generated
              program that you are going to execute. To safeguard against a bug in the code gener‐
              ator, it is recommended to constrain the operations the verifier is allowed to  per‐
              form if you are using a model you did not write yourself. By default this is off.
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 106 (press h for help or q to quit) 

       --scalarset-schedules [on | off]
              Enable  or  disable tracking of the permutation of scalarset values for more compre‐
              hensible counterexample traces. The permuting of scalarset values that is  performed
              during symmetry reduction leads to paths in the state space where a single scalarset
              identity does not have the same value throughout the trace.  When this option is  on
              (the  default),  Rumur  tracks  these  permutations and takes them into account when
              printing scalarset values or reconstructing counterexample  traces.  The  result  is
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 114 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              more  intuitive  and easily understandable traces. Turning this off may gain runtime
              performance on models that use scalarsets. However counterexample traces will likely
              be confusing in this configuration, as scalarset variables will appear to have their
              values change arbitrarily.

       --set-capacity SIZE or -s SIZE
              The size of the initial set to allocate for storing seen states. This  is  given  in
              bytes  and  is interpreted to mean the desired size of the set when it is completely
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 122 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              full. That is, the initial allocation performed will  be  for  a  number  of  "state
              slots"  that,  when  all  occupied, will consume this much memory. Default value for
              this 8MB.

       --set-expand-threshold PERCENT or -e PERCENT
              Expand the state set when its occupancy exceeds  this  percentage.  Default  is  75,
              valid values are 1 - 100. Setting a value of 100 will result in the set only expand‐
              ing when completely full. This may sound ideal, but will actually result in  a  much
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 130 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              longer runtime.

       --symmetry-reduction [off | heuristic | exhaustive]
              Enable or disable symmetry reduction. Symmetry reduction is an optimisation that de‐
              creases the state space that must be searched by deriving a canonical representation
              of each state. While two states may not be directly equal, if their canonical repre‐
              sentations are the same only one of them need be expanded.   To  take  advantage  of
              this  optimisation  you  must  be using named scalarset types. The available options
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 138 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              are:

                     • off Do not use symmetry reduction. All scalarsets will  be  treated  as  if
                       they were range types.

                     • heuristic  Use  a  symmetry  reduction algorithm based on sorting the state
                       data. This is not guaranteed to find a single, canonical representation for
                       each  equivalent state, but it is fast and performs reasonably well empiri‐
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 146 (press h for help or q to quit) 
                       cally. Using this option, you may explore more states  than  you  need  to,
                       with  the advantage that you will process each individual state much faster
                       than with exhaustive. This is the default.

                     • exhaustive Use a symmetry reduction algorithm based on exhaustive  permuta‐
                       tion of the state data. This is guaranteed to find a single, canonical rep‐
                       resentation for each equivalent state, but is typically very slow. Use this
                       if you want to minimise memory usage at the expense of runtime.
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 154 (press h for help or q to quit) 

       --threads COUNT or -t COUNT
              Specify  the  number  of threads the verifier should use. If you do not specify this
              parameter or pass 0, the number of threads will be chosen  based  on  the  available
              hardware threads on the platform on which you generate the model.

       --trace CATEGORY
              Enable tracing of specific events while checking. This option is for debugging Rumur
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 162 (press h for help or q to quit)
              itself, and lets you generate a verifier that writes events  to  stderr.   Available
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 163 (press h for help or q to quit)
              event categories are:

                     • handle_reads Reads from variable handles
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 166 (press h for help or q to quit) 

                     • handle_writes Writes to variable handles

                     • memory_usage Summary of memory allocation during checking

                     • queue Events relating to the pending state queue

                     • set Events relating to the seen state set
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 174 (press h for help or q to quit) 

                     • symmetry_reduction Events related to the symmetry reduction optimisation

                     • all Enable all of the above

              More than one of these can be enabled at once by passing the --trace argument multi‐
              ple times. Note that enabling tracing will significantly slow the  verifier  and  is
              only intended for debugging purposes.
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 182 (press h for help or q to quit) 

       --value-type TYPE
              Change  the C type used to represent scalar values in the generated verifier.  Valid
              values are auto and the C fixed-width types,  int8_t,  uint8_t,  int16_t,  uint16_t,
              int32_t,  uint32_t, int64_t, and uint64_t. The type you select is mapped to its fast
              equivalent (e.g. int_fast8_t) and then used in the verifier.  The  default  is  auto
              that selects the narrowest type that can contain all the scalar types in use in your
              model. It is possible that your model does some arithmetic that temporarily  exceeds
 Manual page temp.N5mVMG line 190 (press h for help or q to quit) 
              the  bound  of  any  declared type in your model, in which case you will need to use
              this option to select a wider type. However, this is not a common case.

       --verbose or -v
              Output informational messages while generating the verifier.

       --version
              Display version information and exit.

This is a murphi model checker generated from the romp random walker tool.
   generated from: bug4.m


CLI USAGE:    <> - required  {} - optional  * - can have 0 or more
   ./<this-file> {options}*


NOTE:
  Option flags and arguments are NOT POSIX compliant!
  Please separate all options and their arguments with spaces,
   and do not join multiple short option flags into one.
    (i.e. `-s <str/int>` and `-y` must be input as
          ``-y -s 5`` and NOT ``-ys 5``, ``-ys5``, 
            ``-ys=5``, ``-y -s=5``, or ``-y --seed=5``)

GENERAL OPTIONS:
   -h | --help      Display help information (this page).
   -y | -l          Launch without prompting (skip launch prompt).
   --list-starts    Output a list of all the ruleset expanded
     | -ls            startstates & their id's
                     (see --start-id/-sid for more info)

RANDOM WALKER OPTIONS:
  --depth <int>     Maximum number of rules to apply in a walk 
    | -d <int>        before termination.
                      default: 1024
  --threads <int>   Specifies the number of threads to use.
    | -ptn <int>      default: 14 (machine specific)
  --walks <int>     Specifies the number of random  walks to do.
     | -w <int>       default: 16 * #-of-threads
  --single-walk     Perform a single random walker on a single thread.
     | -sw            note: overrides -ptn/--threads 
                              & -w/--walks/--walk-count
  --seed <str/int>  Random seed for generating the random walks
    | -s <str/int>    default: current system time
  --even-start      Determine startstate for even distribution
    | -es             rather than random choice (default behavior).
  --start-id <id>   Set a single startstate to use (For all walks).
    | -sid <id>       <id> is an int determined by a startstate's
                      position in the file after ruleset expansion.
                      Valid <id> values are integers between:
                         0 to 9 inclusive
                      Use -ls/--list-starts to see mappings of id's
                        to the ruleset expanded startstates of
                        of your model.
                      NOTE: overrides --even-start/-es

INITIAL BFS CONFIGURATION:
You can start your romp with a limited Breadth first search by using the
 following command.  This can allow you to increase the likely converge of the
 statespace covered by each romp, but does prevent you from using the normal
 strategy of using a mass romp then repeating walks of interest in a 
 single walk with traces enabled.  This is because the pseudo random nature of
 the romp process is not preserved through the BFS process.  We recommend
 instead just rerunning the same config with traces enabled if you need more
 detailed information, it may be slower but it will work.
  --bfs {single|multi} {int}  Enables an initial Breadth First Search of the
    | -bfs {s|m} {int}          statespace, that is either single threaded or
                                multithreaded (defaults to single).
                                The BFS will terminate and a swarm of random
                                walkers will start when there are enough
                                unique states in the BFS queue to have the
                                number of walkers specified with the `-w` flag
                                where each unique state gets {int} random walks
                                to increase the total coverage
                                ({int} defaults to 16).
  --bfs-limit <int>           Sets a limit on how long the initial BFS can go
    | -bfsl <int>               on for.  This is measured in number of rules
                                applied. (<int> defaults to 32767)

  --no-deadlock           Disable Deadlock detection.
    | -nd                   (overrides all property options below)
  --attempt-guard {int}   Stop a random walk if no randomly 
    | -ag {int}             selected rule can be applied to a State
                            after {int} many rules in a row.
                            {int} - an optional arg (see above).
                              (default: 2x #-of-rules in the model)
  --loop-limit {int}      Same thing as --attempt-guard/-ag. 
    | -ll {int}             {int} - an optional arg (see above).
                              (default: 2x #-of-rules in the model)

Trace Options	
  --trace {dir-path}    Enable detailed traces to be made for every
    | -t {dir-path}       random walk performed. Outputs as a 
                          separate ``compressed json'' file for 
                          each random walk performed.
                          NOTE: slows down the process noticeably!
                          {dir-path} - (optional) the directory you
                            want to have the trace files output to.
                            default: "./traces/"

RESULT OUTPUT OPTIONS:
  --report-error        Provide detailed report for each walk that
    | -re                 ends in an ``error''.
    | -e                  (aka: violates a property or reaches a 
                            murphi error statement)
                          (NOTE: --single-walk/-sw only outputs 
                            this and not the summery data)  --report-all          Report on all walks not just those with 
    | --all              ``errors''. Including those stopped by 
    | -a                  the --attempt-guard/-ag/--loop-limit/-ll
                          option, or max --depth/-d being reached.
  --r-omit-state        Don't output the values in the model state
    | -ros                in the results
  --r-show-type         Output variable type next to name when
    | -rst                reporting the value of the model state
  --r-tab-size <int>    Set the indentation size for the result 
    | -rts <int>          output (NOTE: not used for trace output)
                          (default: 2)
  --r-use-tab           Indent using tab chars instead of spaces.
    | -rut                (NOTE: not used in json trace output)
                          (NOTE: overrides --r-tab-size/-rts)
